Ever wondered how unlucky you were in your head-to-head fantasy league? What if you ran the league thousands of times with 1000s of different schedules? 

This repo has the code to do this, you just need the player ID of each of the people in your league.

To use it from the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelcraiger/fantasy_league_analyser
```
Navigate to the directory, and using conda create a new environment using the YAML file
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
